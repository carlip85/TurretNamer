# TurretNamer
A tool to automate the task of setting up many turrets in ARK: Survival Evolved

How to Use Turret Namer

1. Start .exe
2. Enter desired name (Up to 32 characters)
3. Select targeting options
4. Select range options
5. Enter PIN (Must be 4 numbers)
6. Slide to select how much ammo to place (By the stack)

It is VERY important the turret has power, it does not need to turned on, but it must be "powered". You must also have a tribe/rank system as it will add a menu to the main wheel.

Once you have everything chosen you must push the SET button. 

The program will minimize to the tray and you can start setting up turrets.

Press F10 to initialize the macro.
Press F11 to open the main menu for new settings.
Press F8 to quit the program.
